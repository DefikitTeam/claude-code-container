# This is a developer-specific environment file.
# It is not tracked by git and should be created locally by each developer.

# To use this file, you must have a `.dev.vars` file in the root of your project.
# You can create one by running `cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars` in your terminal.
# You can then fill in the values for the variables in the `.dev.vars` file.

# The `wrangler dev` command will automatically load the variables from the `.dev.vars` file.
# The `wrangler deploy` command will not use this file, and you will need to set the secrets in the Cloudflare dashboard.

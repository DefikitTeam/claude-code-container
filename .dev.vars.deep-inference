# Deep Reasoning Configuration
# Prioritize quality over speed for better analysis results

# Enable Deep Reasoning System (default: true)
# This will increase processing time from 5-10s to 30-120s but significantly improve quality
ENABLE_DEEP_REASONING=true

# Deep reasoning complexity threshold (0.0-1.0)
# Issues above this complexity automatically use deep reasoning
# Lower values = more issues use deep reasoning
DEEP_REASONING_THRESHOLD=0.3

# Force specific deep reasoning profile for all issues (optional)
# Options: thorough, deep, ultra_deep
# Leave empty for automatic selection based on issue complexity
# FORCE_DEEP_PROFILE=deep

# Increase processing timeout to accommodate deep reasoning
# Default: 45000 (45s) -> Recommended: 180000 (180s/3min)
PROCESSING_TIMEOUT=180000

# Claude API timeout (should match processing timeout)
CLAUDE_CODE_TIMEOUT=180000

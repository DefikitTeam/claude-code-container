# Claude Code Container – Business Specification

## 1. Executive Overview

Claude Code Container is a secure, multi-tenant automation layer that converts
natural-language software change intents (from GitHub issues, API prompts, or
future product UIs) into validated, auditable code contributions (pull requests)
across connected repositories. It bridges AI-assisted development with
enterprise-grade governance by isolating execution, encrypting credentials, and
enforcing structured processing of user intent.

It is the AI execution and automation substrate that Lumilink (and other
internal or partner platforms) will invoke to transform requirements—whether ad
hoc prompts, structured “spec tasks,” or workflow triggers—into incremental,
reviewable code outputs.

The system reduces engineering cycle time, increases consistency in
implementation quality, and provides a controlled adoption path for AI inside
modern source-centric delivery pipelines.

## 2. Strategic Value Proposition

1. Acceleration: Cuts requirement-to-PR time for small/medium changes from
   hours/days to minutes.
2. Governance by Design: All automated changes are review-first (PRs), never
   silent edits.
3. Secure AI Ops: Isolated container execution prevents key leakage and reduces
   blast radius.
4. Multi-Tenant Enablement: One deployed edge footprint serves many
   installations cleanly.
5. Integratability: Simple APIs and ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) enable
   external products (e.g., Lumilink) and other autonomous agents to orchestrate
   and chain workflows (spec → plan → code → refine) without embedding
   credential or repo logic.
6. Repeatable Automation: Standardizes downstream processes (prompt ingestion →
   context assembly → reasoning → artifact generation).
7. Developer Adoption Path: Augments developers; does not bypass code review or
   branch policies.
8. Extensibility: New execution “types” (analysis, refactor, scaffold, spec
   generation) and inter-agent capabilities (multi-phase session chaining,
   capability negotiation) can be added without redesign.
9. Ecosystem Leverage: Transforms from a single automation engine into a
   composable execution node within multi-agent architectures (IDE assistants,
   planning engines, validation services).

## 3. Stakeholders & Personas

- Platform Engineering: Operates and configures the deployment; ensures SLAs,
  observability, compliance posture.
- Application Developers: Request implementations, review AI-generated changes,
  iterate via prompt refinement.
- Product Managers / Analysts: Supply structured requirements converted into
  executable tasks.
- Security & Compliance: Audit encryption strategy, access boundaries, data
  handling, failure modes.
- Dev Leads / QA: Validate code quality patterns; refine acceptance criteria
  templates.
- External Integrators / Lumilink Backend: Invoke processing APIs to integrate
  into wider knowledge/workflow systems.
- Orchestration Agents (e.g., Lumilink workflow engine): Sequence multi-phase
  tasks (plan → implement → document) via ACP sessions.
- Knowledge / Context Agents: Supply curated domain or codebase slices injected
  as structured resources to improve precision.
- Validation / Policy Agents (future): Perform post-generation checks (tests,
  compliance) and optionally trigger refinement sessions.
- Executive Sponsors: Track productivity metrics, adoption curves, and risk
  profile.
- Open Source / Community (optional future): Contribute adapters or execution
  modes safely.

## 4. Core Business Capabilities

1. Intent Ingestion:
   - GitHub issues (classic workflow).
   - Direct API prompts (for product integration and UI-less automation).
   - Future: batched task lists, spec artifacts (e.g., Lumilink-generated
     structured requirements).
2. Context Assembly:
   - Repository cloning (shallow).
   - Intelligent scoping (target files, diffable impact zones).
3. AI Reasoning + Code Generation:
   - Use Claude models with optional advanced reasoning toggles.
   - Structured multi-step tool use (analyze → plan → implement → refine →
     summarize).
4. Controlled Code Output:
   - Branch creation & PR generation (never direct push to protected branches).
   - Detailed PR narratives (what/why/limitations).
5. Secure Runtime Isolation:
   - Container per execution type instance (with bounded lifetime).
   - No persistent storage of decrypted secrets beyond lifecycle.
6. Credential & Secret Governance:
   - Encrypted durable storage.
   - Minimal surface exposure; ephemeral runtime injection.
7. Deployment & Provisioning Automation:
   - Guided “one-click” derivative repository deployments for users.
   - Self-service onboarding with minimal operational friction.
8. Observability & Status Exposure:
   - Health endpoints, structured response payloads, progress/status messaging.
9. Extensible Task Types:
   - Pluggable handler pattern for expansion (e.g., “plan-only”, “spec refine”,
     “refactor”, “audit”).
10. Integration Bridge (Lumilink Alignment):

- Acts as execution arm for upstream knowledge or planning systems.
- Can return structured metadata for ingestion (e.g., PR link, generated
  artifacts references).

11. Inter-Agent Session Protocol (ACP):
    - JSON-RPC style session lifecycle (initialize → session/new →
      session/prompt → cancel/setMode) enabling external orchestrators.
    - Scoped file interaction via mediated read/write operations (supports
      compliance and minimal exposure).
    - Permission modes balancing speed vs oversight (accept edits vs always
      ask).
    - Multi-phase chaining: Distinct sessions for plan, implement, refinement
      tied by external orchestration metadata.
    - Cancellation & error taxonomy (auth_error, fs_permission, cancelled,
      unknown) for automated policy handling.

## 5. Primary Use Cases (Business Framing)

1. Rapid Feature Skeleton: PM describes a small feature → AI generates
   scaffolding PR → developer iterates.
2. Bug Repair: Issue with reproduction steps → automated patch PR → human
   validation.
3. Documentation Improvement: Prompt triggers targeted README/API doc
   augmentation.
4. Refactor Assist: High-level “modularize X” request → structured multi-file PR
   with rationale.
5. Specification Realization (Lumilink Flow): Lumilink produces structured spec
   → container converts to initial codebase changes.
6. Multi-Repo Update: Consistent change (e.g., license header, API signature)
   across several installations via batch prompting.
7. Onboarding Automation: New forked user repo set up with working automation
   pipeline in minutes.
8. Compliance-Friendly Audit Trail: Every automated change is traceable (input →
   generated PR artifacts).
9. Experimentation Sandbox: Teams test AI change velocity without risking
   production branch integrity.
10. Internal Adoption Pilot: Measure time savings vs manual development to
    justify scaled rollout.
11. Multi-Agent Chained Workflow: Orchestration engine triggers plan-only
    session → reviews plan → triggers implementation session → triggers
    documentation enhancement session.
12. External Validation Loop: Policy/validation agent consumes PR + reasoning
    summary, then requests refinement session if quality thresholds unmet.
13. Context-Enriched Enhancement: Knowledge agent injects curated domain
    snippets (architecture notes, service contracts) to improve accuracy of
    generated refactors.

## 6. In-Scope vs Out-of-Scope

In-Scope:

- Secure automation of code change proposals.
- Multi-tenant GitHub App credential brokering.
- AI-driven reasoning and iterative generation loops.
- Deployment facilitation (fork-based pipeline) for user-owned instances.
- Structured JSON APIs for orchestration.
- Extension of task “types” (additive pattern).
- Observability hooks (health, statuses).

Out-of-Scope (Current Phase):

- Direct merge automation without human approval.
- Full CI/CD orchestration or test execution pipelines.
- LLM fine-tuning or self-hosted model hosting.
- Large-scale data ingestion or vector knowledge embedding (delegated to
  Lumilink).
- Billing / monetization engine (future overlay).
- In-depth compliance reporting (baseline encryption only).
- Real-time collaboration UX (handled by upstream products).

## 7. Operating Model

Deployment Footprint:

- Edge-first (Cloudflare Workers + Containers) reduces latency and operational
  overhead.
- Horizontal scaling via container instances; vertical complexity minimized.

Execution Lifecycle (Business View):

1. Request or Session Initiation (issue, direct prompt, or ACP
   initialize/session/new).
2. Validation & Eligibility (permissions, configuration, quota, mode selection).
3. Context Acquisition (repo clone, curated resource injection via agents).
4. AI Processing (plan → implement → refine) possibly segmented across multiple
   ACP sessions.
5. Output Serialization (PR, logs, reasoning summary, session lineage metadata).
6. Result Delivery (links + structured response + optional session correlation
   IDs).
7. Cleanup & Metrics Emission (including multi-session chain metrics).

Security & Trust Posture:

- Encryption at rest (credentials inside Durable Objects).
- Ephemeral in-memory use of decrypted data.
- Least privilege GitHub App scopes.
- Explicit error surfacing—no silent fallbacks to insecure defaults.
- Isolation prevents cross-tenant data leakage (business-critical for
  multi-client adoption).

Reliability & SLA Targets (Aspirational):

- 99% successful task orchestration for well-formed inputs.
- P95 end-to-end turnaround for small tasks < 5 minutes.
- Degraded mode policy: partial failure returns structured diagnostics, not
  opaque errors.

Scalability Considerations:

- Task-level concurrency; bounded container instance pools.
- Stateless Worker control plane enables global distribution.
- Additive task types impose negligible coupling.

Cost Efficiency:

- On-demand ephemeral compute prevents idle burn.
- Shallow clone + selective file operations reduce runtime.

Observability (Business Indicators):

- Success/failure ratio by task type.
- Mean Time to First PR (MTTFPR).
- Review acceptance rate (PR merged vs closed).
- Rework index (subsequent manual modifications density).
- Session Chain Completion Rate (planned multi-phase sequences reaching final
  stage).
- Context Efficiency Ratio (useful diff size vs provided context volume proxy).
- External Orchestrated Share (% tasks initiated via ACP vs issue-only input).

## 10. Competitive & Positioning Notes

Differentiators:

- Edge-native architecture vs centralized AI runners.
- Security-first (encryption + isolation) compared to “bot pushes directly”
  tooling.
- Extensible execution types enabling compound workflows (spec → implement).
- Designed as an embedded execution service for platforms (Lumilink), not just a
  standalone “AI bot.”

Alternatives (Build vs Buy):

- Internal script automation (high maintenance, brittle).
- Generic AI copilots (lack repository lifecycle integration + multi-tenant
  governance).
- Full Dev Platform vendors (greater scope, slower iteration, higher cost).

## 11. Success Criteria for “Mature State”

- 70%+ of small change PRs initiated via the system in pilot teams.
- <10% PRs require major rewrite (objective rework metric).
- Sub-5 minute P95 latency for typical ops.
- Zero critical security incidents.
- Documented ROI case (time saved vs baseline across 3 teams).
- Clear extension path adopted by Lumilink product flows.

## 12. Guiding Principles

1. Human-in-the-loop always remains central (PR-centric).
2. Explicitness over implicit magic (transparent logs & rationale).
3. Secure by default; no optional weakening of boundaries.
4. Additive evolution—never break existing task contracts.
5. Fast feedback beats speculative complexity.
6. Platform-first: treat external orchestrators (e.g., Lumilink) as primary
   clients.

## 13. Governance & Compliance Alignment (Business Layer)

- Audit artifacts: each task retains (a) input summary, (b) PR URL, (c)
  classification of task type, (d) high-level reasoning summary (redacted of
  secrets).
- Data Minimization: Only repository scope required for requested change is
  analyzed; no broad content indexing stored.
- Incident Response: Failures categorized; security-sensitive anomalies trigger
  escalation flag.

## 14. Financial / Cost Considerations (Directional)

Cost Drivers:

- LLM tokens (primary variable cost).
- Edge/container runtime usage (bounded by concurrency).
- GitHub API rate consumption.

Efficiency Strategies:

- Adaptive reasoning depth for low-risk tasks.
- Reuse shallow clones with ephemeral TTL windows (if allowed).
- Limit multi-step tool loops unless high-confidence improvement expected.

## 15. Expansion Opportunities

- Intelligent test generation in tandem with code changes.
- Auto-changelog + release note drafting per merged PR cluster.
- Policy-as-prompt: embed organizational engineering standards into reasoning
  loop.
- Marketplace for contributed task modules (curated).

## 16. Exit Criteria for Pilot → Broad Rollout

- Achieved target KPIs (latency, adoption, quality).
- Security review sign-off.
- Cost per task within set budget tolerance.
- Positive developer satisfaction survey (≥80% favorable).
- Playbooks documented for operations & incident handling.

## 17. Glossary (Business Terms)

- Task Type: Category of automated operation (e.g., implement, refactor, doc
  enhance).
- Installation: A bound GitHub App + repository scope under a tenant.
- Intent: User’s natural language or structured requirement input.
- Execution Session: One end-to-end automated processing attempt.
- Artifact: Output entity (PR, patch diff, narrative summary).
- Isolation Boundary: Execution environment segregation preventing cross-tenant
  state access.
- ACP Session: A structured, protocol-governed interaction unit (initialize →
  session/new → prompt cycles) enabling external orchestration.
- Orchestration Agent: External system coordinating multi-phase or
  multi-repository automation sequences.
- Capability Negotiation (Future): Process by which agents declare supported
  operations to optimize routing and task decomposition.
- Session Chain / Lineage: Linked sequence of ACP sessions representing phased
  delivery (plan → implement → refine).

## 18. Non-Functional (Business-Level) Targets

- Availability: Target >99% for control plane endpoints.
- Transparency: 100% of failures produce actionable message.
- Data Residency: Neutral (edge distributed), with future option for region
  pinning if required.
- Observability: Core metrics accessible within internal dashboards (future
  integration requirement).

## 19. Summary Statement

Claude Code Container serves as the secure AI execution core for transforming
human intent into reviewable software change artifacts—accelerating delivery
while preserving trust, governance, and extensibility. It is positioned not
merely as an “AI bot,” but as a substrate enabling higher-order product
experiences (e.g., Lumilink’s knowledge-driven workflows) and disciplined,
auditable automation.

# GitHub Actions Workflow Not Appearing?

If you don't see the "Deploy to Cloudflare Workers" workflow in your GitHub Actions tab after forking, here are the solutions:

## ‚úÖ **Quick Fixes**

### 1. **Refresh & Wait**
- Refresh your browser page
- Wait 30-60 seconds for GitHub to detect the workflow files
- Check the Actions tab again

### 2. **Force Repository Sync**
```bash
# In your forked repository on GitHub:
# 1. Click "Sync fork" button (if available)
# 2. Click "Update branch"
# 3. Refresh the Actions tab
```

### 3. **Trigger via Push**
Make any small change to trigger the workflow:
```bash
# Edit the README.md file on GitHub and commit
# OR push any change to main branch
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-code-container.git
cd claude-code-container
echo "# My deployment" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger workflow"
git push origin main
```

### 4. **Verify Workflow File Exists**
Check that this file exists in your fork:
```
.github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

If it's missing, the fork might not have copied all files. Re-fork the repository.

## üîç **Expected Behavior**

After forking, you should see:
- **Actions tab** with "Deploy to Cloudflare Workers" workflow
- **Green "Run workflow" button** for manual deployment
- **Automatic runs** when you push to main branch

## üÜò **Still Not Working?**

If the workflow still doesn't appear:
1. **Check repository permissions** - Make sure Actions are enabled
2. **Try the CLI method** - Use local deployment instead
3. **Open an issue** - Report the problem in the main repository

## üöÄ **Alternative: CLI Deployment**

If GitHub Actions continues to have issues, you can deploy locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-code-container.git
cd claude-code-container
npm install
cd container_src && npm install && cd ..
wrangler login
wrangler deploy
```

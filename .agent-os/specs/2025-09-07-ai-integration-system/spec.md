# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: AI Integration System Created: 2025-09-07 Status: Planning

## Overview

Create an integration system that enables external AI systems to seamlessly
connect with claude-code-container Workers through automated GitHub App
installation, Worker deployment, and Agent-to-Agent communication. This system
will streamline the onboarding process for external AI systems while maintaining
security and user control through individual Worker deployments.

## User Stories

### External AI System Integration

As an external AI system developer, I want to integrate with
claude-code-container capabilities, so that my users can leverage automated
GitHub issue processing and code generation without manual setup complexity.

The integration flow guides users through GitHub App installation, automated
Worker deployment via GitHub Actions, and establishes secure Agent-to-Agent
communication channels. The system collects deployment URLs and configures
authentication, enabling seamless API communication between external systems and
deployed Workers.

### User Onboarding Automation

As a user of an external AI system, I want to easily connect my repositories to
claude-code-container functionality, so that I can benefit from automated issue
processing without technical configuration overhead.

Users follow a guided flow: install GitHub App on target repositories, deploy
their own Worker instance via GitHub fork and Actions, then return to the
external system with their Worker URL. The integration system automatically
configures the Worker with proper credentials and enables immediate
functionality.

### Agent-to-Agent Communication

As an external AI system, I want to send natural language prompts to deployed
Workers, so that I can create GitHub issues and pull requests on behalf of users
through automated code analysis and generation.

External systems communicate with user-deployed Workers via the
`/process-prompt` endpoint, sending structured requests containing prompts,
repository targets, and user context. Workers respond with issue creation, pull
request URLs, and execution status, enabling seamless automation workflows.

## Spec Scope

1. **Integration API Endpoints** - REST API for external system registration,
   user onboarding workflow management, and deployment orchestration
2. **Automated Deployment Flow** - GitHub Actions integration for repository
   forking, secret configuration, and Worker deployment automation
3. **Worker URL Registry** - System for collecting, validating, and managing
   deployed Worker URLs with user associations and health monitoring
4. **Auto-Configuration System** - Automated GitHub App credential configuration
   via existing `/config` API with validation and error handling
5. **Agent-to-Agent Communication** - Authenticated API communication channels
   between external systems and deployed Workers via `/process-prompt` endpoint

## Out of Scope

- GitHub App creation (uses existing fixed/shared GitHub App)
- Custom deployment workflows (leverages existing GitHub Actions)
- Real-time deployment streaming (uses polling + webhook callbacks)
- Multi-organization GitHub deployments in first iteration
- Complex user customization during deployment process
- Worker resource management or scaling beyond individual deployments

## Expected Deliverable

1. External AI systems can successfully register and guide users through the
   complete integration flow from GitHub App installation to active Worker
   deployment
2. Users can deploy their own claude-code-container Worker instances through
   automated GitHub fork and Actions without manual configuration
3. Deployed Workers are automatically configured with proper GitHub App
   credentials and ready for Agent-to-Agent communication within 10 minutes of
   deployment initiation

# AI Integration System - Lite Summary

Create an integration system that enables external AI systems to seamlessly connect with claude-code-container Workers through automated GitHub App installation, Worker deployment, and Agent-to-Agent communication. The system streamlines onboarding by guiding users through GitHub App installation, automated Worker deployment via GitHub Actions, and establishes secure API communication channels. This eliminates manual configuration overhead while maintaining security through individual Worker deployments and encrypted credential management.

## Key Points
- Automated GitHub App installation and Worker deployment pipeline
- Secure Agent-to-Agent communication through standardized API interfaces
- Streamlined onboarding that eliminates manual configuration overhead

# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-07-ai-integration-system/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-07
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Integration API Layer**: RESTful endpoints built as extensions to existing src/index.ts Worker with TypeScript interfaces for external system registration, user onboarding workflow management, and deployment status tracking
- **Worker URL Registry**: Extend existing UserConfigDO Durable Object to store Worker URLs with user associations, health monitoring, and validation mechanisms
- **Automated Deployment Orchestration**: GitHub API integration for repository forking, GitHub Actions workflow triggering with secret injection, and deployment status polling
- **Configuration Automation**: Leverage existing /config endpoint with automated credential injection using fixed GitHub App credentials and installation-specific configuration
- **Authentication System**: API key-based authentication for external systems with request signing and rate limiting integration into existing middleware
- **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Extend existing /process-prompt endpoint with authentication headers and external system identification for routing and logging
- **Webhook Callback System**: HTTP webhook endpoints for deployment status notifications with retry logic and failure handling
- **Health Monitoring**: Regular health checks for deployed Workers with status caching and alerting integration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery patterns with exponential backoff, circuit breakers, and user-friendly error messaging
- **Security Implementation**: Request signature validation, encrypted credential storage using existing AES-256-GCM patterns, and audit logging for all integration operations

## Approach

### Architecture Pattern
- **Microservices Extension**: Build integration features as modular extensions to existing Worker architecture without disrupting core functionality
- **Event-Driven Design**: Utilize webhook patterns and async processing for deployment orchestration and status updates
- **State Management**: Leverage existing Durable Objects pattern with new integration-specific state containers

### Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Core API endpoints and authentication system
- **Phase 2**: GitHub integration and deployment automation
- **Phase 3**: Health monitoring and webhook callback systems
- **Phase 4**: Advanced error handling and security hardening

### Data Flow Architecture
```
External System → API Gateway → Authentication → Integration Controller → GitHub API → Deployment Pipeline → Status Webhook → External System
```

### Security Architecture
- **Multi-layered Authentication**: API keys + request signatures + rate limiting
- **Encrypted Storage**: AES-256-GCM for all sensitive integration credentials
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all integration operations for security and compliance

## External Dependencies

- **@octokit/rest** - GitHub API client for repository forking, Actions workflow management, and installation handling
- **Justification:** Required for automated GitHub repository operations and Actions workflow triggering that are core to the deployment automation flow

> Spec: Deploy on Cloudflare Button Implementation Created: 2025-09-05 Status:
> Planning

## Overview

Implement a "Deploy on Cloudflare" button feature that streamlines the
deployment process for users who want to fork and deploy the Claude Code
Container Worker. This feature will provide a one-click solution that guides
users through the entire setup process, from repository forking to production
deployment.

## User Stories

As a developer discovering the Claude Code Container project, I want to be able
to deploy it to my own Cloudflare account with minimal manual configuration, so
that I can quickly test and use the system without going through complex setup
procedures.

As a project maintainer, I want to reduce the barrier to entry for new users, so
that more people can easily try and adopt the Claude Code Container system.

As a technical user, I want the deployment process to handle the complex
configuration automatically while still giving me control over critical settings
like API keys and GitHub App configuration.

## Spec Scope

- Create a Deploy on Cloudflare button with automated workflow
- Implement repository template functionality for easy forking
- Develop automated deployment script that handles Wrangler configuration
- Create guided setup flow for required credentials (Anthropic API key, GitHub
  App)
- Implement environment variable configuration through the deployment process
- Provide clear status feedback during deployment
- Handle deployment errors gracefully with helpful troubleshooting guidance
- Ensure deployed instance is immediately functional after setup completion

## Out of Scope

- Custom domain configuration (users can set this up manually after deployment)
- Advanced Cloudflare settings configuration (KV namespaces, custom rules)
- GitHub App creation wizard (users need to create their own GitHub App)
- Multi-region deployment options
- Backup and restore functionality
- Advanced monitoring and analytics setup

## Expected Deliverable

A fully functional "Deploy on Cloudflare" button integrated into the README
that:

- Provides one-click forking and deployment
- Guides users through required credential setup
- Handles all Wrangler configuration automatically
- Deploys a working Claude Code Container instance
- Includes proper error handling and user feedback
- Works seamlessly with the existing codebase architecture

The implementation should reduce deployment time from 30+ minutes of manual
setup to under 10 minutes including credential configuration.

# Feature Specification: LumiLink-BE ACP Protocol Integration

**Feature Branch**: `002-integrate-lumilink-be`  
**Created**: September 17, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Integrate lumilink-be with ACP protocol for
claude-code-container system to replace current WEB API communication. This
integration should leverage the new Application Communication Protocol (ACP)
we've implemented in the container system for more efficient and structured
communication between lumilink-be backend and claude-code containers,
eliminating the need for HTTP-based API calls and enabling direct protocol-level
communication with better performance, type safety, and real-time capabilities."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a LumiLink-BE user managing containerized AI workflows, I need the system to
communicate with Claude Code containers through a more efficient protocol than
HTTP APIs, so that I can experience faster response times, better reliability,
and real-time status updates during container operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a LumiLink-BE instance with ACP integration enabled, **When** I
   deploy a new container, **Then** the system establishes an ACP connection and
   reports successful deployment without HTTP API calls
2. **Given** an active container session via ACP, **When** I send a code
   analysis request, **Then** I receive real-time progress updates and faster
   completion than the previous HTTP-based approach
3. **Given** multiple concurrent container operations, **When** the ACP protocol
   is used, **Then** the system handles all communications without HTTP request
   queuing or timeout issues
4. **Given** a container becomes unresponsive, **When** using ACP communication,
   **Then** the system detects the disconnection immediately and provides
   real-time status updates
5. **Given** existing HTTP-based container integrations, **When** the ACP
   migration is activated, **Then** all functionality remains identical from the
   user perspective while performance improves

### Edge Cases

- What happens when ACP connection fails during critical operations and fallback
  to HTTP is needed?
- How does the system handle version mismatches between LumiLink-BE ACP client
  and container ACP agent?
- What occurs when containers are deployed with mixed protocol support (some
  ACP, some HTTP)?
- How does the system manage ACP connection recovery after network
  interruptions?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST establish ACP connections to Claude Code containers
  instead of HTTP communication
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain all existing container management
  capabilities during protocol migration
- **FR-003**: Users MUST experience improved response times for container
  operations compared to HTTP-based communication
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide real-time status updates for container
  operations through ACP protocol
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle ACP connection failures gracefully with
  appropriate error reporting
- **FR-006**: System MUST support bidirectional communication with containers
  for interactive operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate ACP message integrity and handle
  protocol-level errors
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain session state consistency across ACP
  connections
- **FR-009**: System MUST support concurrent ACP connections to multiple
  containers simultaneously
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide fallback mechanisms when ACP communication is
  unavailable
- **FR-011**: System MUST authenticate and authorize ACP connections using
  existing security models
- **FR-012**: System MUST log ACP communication events for debugging and audit
  purposes
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle container lifecycle events (start, stop,
  restart) through ACP protocol
- **FR-014**: System MUST support streaming responses for long-running container
  operations
- **FR-015**: System MUST migrate existing HTTP-based container configurations
  to ACP without data loss

_Requirements with clarification needed:_

- **FR-016**: System MUST achieve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific performance
  targets - latency reduction percentage, throughput improvements]
- **FR-017**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific ACP protocol
  version compatibility requirements]
- **FR-018**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum number of
  concurrent ACP connections expected]

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: ACP integration MUST NOT break existing container deployment
  workflows
- **NFR-002**: Protocol migration MUST be transparent to end users
- **NFR-003**: ACP communication MUST provide better error diagnostics than HTTP
  APIs
- **NFR-004**: System MUST support ACP protocol upgrades without service
  interruption
- **NFR-005**: ACP connections MUST be more resource-efficient than HTTP
  connections

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **ACP Connection**: Represents persistent communication channel between
  LumiLink-BE and container, with state management and error handling
- **Container Session**: Manages container lifecycle and operations through ACP
  protocol, replacing HTTP-based session management
- **ACP Message**: Structured communication unit containing operation requests,
  responses, and status updates
- **Protocol Configuration**: Settings and parameters for ACP communication,
  including connection timeouts, retry policies, and authentication
- **Migration State**: Tracks the transition from HTTP to ACP protocol for
  existing container integrations

## Integration Context & Rationale

### Current State Analysis

LumiLink-BE currently communicates with Claude Code containers using HTTP API
calls, which introduces several limitations:

- Request/response latency overhead
- Connection pooling complexity
- Limited real-time capabilities
- HTTP timeout and error handling challenges
- Stateless communication requiring frequent re-authentication

### ACP Protocol Advantages

The Application Communication Protocol (ACP) implemented in the
claude-code-container system provides:

- Persistent bidirectional connections
- Real-time message streaming
- Lower protocol overhead
- Built-in session management
- Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
- Type-safe message passing

### Business Impact

This integration will deliver:

- Improved user experience through faster container operations
- Enhanced reliability for containerized AI workflows
- Better resource utilization and reduced infrastructure costs
- Foundation for advanced real-time features
- Simplified debugging and monitoring capabilities

## Next Steps for Stakeholder Review

**Clarification Required:**

1. **Performance Targets**: What specific performance improvements are expected?
   (e.g., "50% reduction in operation latency", "99.9% connection reliability")
2. **Protocol Compatibility**: What ACP protocol versions must be supported for
   backward compatibility?
3. **Scaling Requirements**: What is the expected maximum number of concurrent
   ACP connections?

**Ready for Planning Phase:** Once clarifications are provided, this
specification will be ready for technical planning and implementation design.

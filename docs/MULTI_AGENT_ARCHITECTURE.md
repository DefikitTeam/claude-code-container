## 🎯 Agent Specialization Matrix

| Agent Type | Primary Focus | Tools | Communication Pattern |
|------------|---------------|-------|----------------------|
| **DesignAgent** | UI/UX, Wireframing, User flows | Figma API, Design linters | → FrontendAgent |
| **FrontendAgent** | React, Vue, CSS, Responsive | npm, webpack, testing | ↔ BackendAgent, DesignAgent |  
| **BackendAgent** | APIs, Business logic, Architecture | Database tools, API testing | ↔ FrontendAgent, DatabaseAgent |
| **SecurityAgent** | Auth, CORS, Validation, Encryption | Security scanners, auth tools | → All agents |
| **BlockchainAgent** | Smart contracts, Web3, DeFi | Hardhat, Truffle, Web3 libs | ↔ BackendAgent |
| **DatabaseAgent** | Schema, Queries, Optimization | Prisma, SQL tools | → BackendAgent |
| **TestingAgent** | Unit, Integration, E2E testing | Jest, Cypress, Playwright | → All agents |
| **DevOpsAgent** | CI/CD, Docker, Cloud deployment | Docker, K8s, Cloud CLIs | → All agents |

## 🔄 A2A Communication Patterns

### 1. **Sequential Pattern** (Linear workflow)
```typescript
Issue → RouterAgent → DesignAgent → FrontendAgent → BackendAgent → TestingAgent → DevOpsAgent
```

### 2. **Parallel Pattern** (Independent tasks)
```typescript
Issue → RouterAgent → [DesignAgent, SecurityAgent, DatabaseAgent] → CoordinatorAgent → Solution
```

### 3. **Hierarchical Pattern** (Master-worker)
```typescript
Issue → CoordinatorAgent → {
  DesignAgent → FrontendAgent,
  BackendAgent → DatabaseAgent,
  SecurityAgent → All agents
}
```

### 4. **Peer-to-Peer Pattern** (Dynamic collaboration)
```typescript
Any Agent ↔ Any Agent (based on context and need)
```
